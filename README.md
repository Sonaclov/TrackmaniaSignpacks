## FAQ

### Can other players see my custom signs?

Yes! But only if:
- Your PNG files are hosted on a public web server
- You use the URLs (not local file paths) in the map editor

Local files work for you as the creator, but other players need web-hosted URLs.

### How do I share my design?

Click the "Share" button → Copy the link → Share anywhere!
Others can click it to load your exact design settings.

### Why aren't fonts loading?

- Try refreshing the page
- Some fonts may be blocked by ad blockers
- Disable browser extensions and try again

### How do I report a security issue?

Please email security concerns privately rather than opening a public issue.
